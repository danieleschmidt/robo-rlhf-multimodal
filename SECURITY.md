## Security Best Practices

When using this library:

1. **Environment Isolation**: Use virtual environments
2. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated
3. **Secret Management**: Never commit API keys or credentials
4. **Input Validation**: Validate all external inputs
5. **Access Control**: Use principle of least privilege

## Known Security Considerations

- This library handles sensitive robotics data and model checkpoints
- Ensure secure storage of trained models and datasets
- Be cautious when deploying on real robotic systems
- Validate all external data sources and user inputs
