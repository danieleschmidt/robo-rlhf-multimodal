# robo-rlhf-multimodal
End-to-end pipeline for multimodal reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in robotics. Collect teleoperation data with images and proprioception, gather human preferences, and fine-tune policies using state-of-the-art multimodal RLHF techniques inspired by OpenAI's February 2025 robotics update.
