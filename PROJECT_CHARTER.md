# Project Charter: Robo-RLHF-Multimodal

## Project Vision
Create the world's most comprehensive and accessible framework for training robotic policies using multimodal reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

## Problem Statement
Current robotic learning systems struggle to align with human preferences and intentions, particularly when dealing with complex multimodal observations (vision, proprioception, force). Existing RLHF frameworks are primarily designed for language models and don't address the unique challenges of robotic learning: real-time constraints, safety requirements, multimodal observations, and physical interaction.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Data Collection**: Teleoperation interfaces for multiple input devices (spacemouse, VR, keyboard)
- **Preference Learning**: Web-based interface for collecting human preference comparisons
- **Multimodal RLHF**: Training algorithms that handle vision, proprioception, and force sensing
- **Simulation Support**: Integration with MuJoCo and Isaac Sim environments
- **Real Robot Deployment**: ROS2 integration for real robot deployment
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Built-in safety monitoring and emergency stop capabilities

### Out of Scope
- **Hardware Development**: We don't develop robots, only software for existing platforms  
- **Real Robot Sales**: This is a research/development framework, not a commercial robot platform
- **Custom Simulators**: We integrate with existing simulators, not build new ones
- **Mobile/Web Apps**: Focus is on research and development tools, not consumer applications

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success Criteria
1. **Performance**: 90%+ task success rate on benchmark robotic tasks
2. **Sample Efficiency**: 50% reduction in human annotation time compared to baseline methods
3. **Deployment**: Successful deployment on 3+ different robot platforms
4. **Safety**: Zero critical safety incidents during 1000+ hours of robot operation
5. **Speed**: Real-time policy execution (>10Hz) on standard hardware

### Community Success Criteria
1. **Adoption**: 1000+ GitHub stars and 100+ active users by end of 2025
2. **Contributions**: 50+ merged pull requests from external contributors
3. **Research Impact**: 10+ research papers citing the framework
4. **Industry Usage**: 3+ companies using the framework in production
5. **Documentation**: Complete documentation with 20+ tutorials and examples

3. **Funding Sustainability**: Long-term funding for infrastructure and development
   - *Mitigation*: Diversified funding sources, commercial licensing options

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Technical Debt**: Rapid development leading to unmaintainable code
   - *Mitigation*: Code reviews, testing requirements, refactoring sprints
2. **Scalability Limits**: Framework not handling large-scale deployments
   - *Mitigation*: Early focus on distributed systems, performance testing
